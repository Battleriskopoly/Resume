#Resume
The Total Compilation of my Work Until This Date
<hr>
###C Problem Sets - Winter/Spring 2014
In my first serious attempt to learn to program I followed Harvard's CS50 course online. Throughout the program I learned basic C as well as general computer science and some algorithm design. Provided in the problem set folder are my solutions to the course's weekly tasks.
###G Code Parser for Phidget Stepper Motor Controller - Spring 2013
While in the process of completing CS50, I became interested with building a 3D printer. Although I did not (or I have yet to) finish the project, I did purchase a stepper motor controller to start the building. With little knowledge, I chose a dongle that was really in no shape for 3D printing. However, In an attempt to salvage my investment, I wrote a program in c to interpret G Code CAD data from a file and send coordinates to the motors with an API. This is the only original project I have completed in C.
###The War Room - Spring 2014 to Present
With some friends, I attempted to recreate a mashup board game we play, online. With no knowledge of web development, I started, and in a little under a year, the project has given me a working knowledge of JavaScript Ruby on Rails and programming in general. The game is still being developed. However, we are currently assessing our exact goals and timeframes. Located in the The War Room folder is a copy of the Rails app along with the main document, containing the majority of the code I have written for the project. In its current state, the source will not run, but I include it because it is my single largest project. The JavaScript is not all current. Some is unused and left from previous versions as reference.
###Celador - January 2015
In the Celador folder are the resources for a static website I built for my brother's band. It has yet to be used, and the page is still populated mainly by Ipsum. The site was my first project in web design. It is currently hosted [here](http://development.celadore.divshot.io/index.html?/).
###The War Room Landing Site - February 2015
In preparation for The War Room's release, I built a landing site to direct interest. Most notably the project involved css3 animation html5 video and client side cookies. It is currently hosted [here](http://www.warroomgame.com).
###The Bubbler Bulletin - April 2015
I am building a new website for my school's newspaper. The work has only recently been started and is currently in progress. When finished, it will act as a simple content management system, allowing articles to be posted with limited formatting. Two things of note in the folder are the [sample article](http://development.pac.divshot.io/minithon), and the [submission page](http://development.pac.divshot.io/contentUpload) (currently in progress). The site is currently hosted here
