                <p>High school is the last step before leaving for college. The closer one comes to completing this stage, the more stressful the work gets. Preparing applications, letters of recommendation, and planning college visits may seem overwhelming. But what is even more overwhelming is doing it all without much instruction. Several kinds of standardized tests are offered before graduation. Standardized testing evaluates all students on the same material, and reports to colleges how prepared one is for college-level work. Some are necessary for a college application. Some are to earn scholarships or college credits. Some can be used to show colleges a studentâ€™s strengths. Which ones are worth taking?</p><p>

                    The most common question about standardized testing is about the SAT and the ACT. Which one is more important? Both tests are equally important, and most colleges accept either ACT or SAT scores, but check the requirements before deciding. The SAT is a standardized test broken down into three major sections: writing, reading, and math. Each section is evaluated out of 800, and adding all three scores together will show the score. Typically, one takes the SAT their junior year, and usually takes it twice. In 2013, the average score was 1497. The ACT is broken down into four major sections: English, math, reading, and science. Compared to the SAT, where an essay section is mandatory, the ACT has an optional 30-minute essay section. Each section is scored between 1 and 36, and then all four scores are averaged together to get a composite score, which will fall between 1 and 36. The national average is 21. This test is usually taken in the spring of Junior year.</p>
                How does one register for the SAT or the ACT? It is a simple process. For the SAT, visit collegeboard.org. There, click on SAT and Register. Once a profile is set up, a ticket will be available. One must present this ticket to enter the testing center. A photo ID is also necessary for entry. The cost is usually between $50 and $60. Usually, the test is taken at Carlisle High School. The next available test date is May 2, and the registration deadline is April 6. For the ACT, visit actstudent.org. There, set up an account and register. The ACT is $38 without the additional writing section and $54 with the writing section. The next available test date is June 13, and the registration deadline is May 8.</p><p>

                    The second most commonly asked question is about subject tests. What is the difference between an SAT subject test and an AP exam? SAT subject tests are hour-long tests on individually chosen subjects. They are the only standardized tests that showcase individual areas of expertise. Some colleges use the scores to help place students in courses in which they would excel. There are 20 subject tests in five areas: English, science, math, history, and languages. The exams are $52.50. The next available test date is May 2 and the registration deadline is April 6. The AP exams are available to all students whether they are taking the course or not. They are taken in May. There are 36 exams available, each of which is $82. They are usually two-three hours long and are taken during the school day. So why take these exams? Most colleges want to see that a student has taken at least two AP courses or exams. Doing well on one of the exams can earn awards that can be used on applications for college and for future jobs. Also, earning a score of a three or higher may earn the student college course credits, depending on the school they attend. Earning these course credits is important. Students who have more course credits starting college will be able to schedule before other students, and it can save thousands of dollars on actual college classes.</p><p>

                    There are so many choices to make as a student progresses through high school. Junior year is usually considered the hardest year, packed full of college preparation before enjoying senior year. It is a year to try new things. So, take an extra standardized test, ask a guidance counselor questions, or try an internship. Make these decisions now, so when senior year comes, all of the frantic questions will be answered.
